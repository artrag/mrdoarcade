# Mr. Do Arcade ColecoVision Rom Hack

This work is based on the original Mr. Do game for the ColecoVision and was made possible by the disassembly work done by Captain Cosmos on the Atari Age forums.

Changes:
- Arcade Title screen
- Redesigned sprites (created by TIX@AtariAge)
- Fix full screen image intermission for Extra Mr. Do
- Extra Mr. Do tune (Astro Boy theme song)
- Main background music (the Can Can song)
- Lose a life jingle
- End of round jingle
- "Extra" letter mode/chomper jingle
- Screen stays red for "Extra" alphamonster/chomper mode
- Updated collision detection so Mr. Do doesn't get stuck after intersecting an apple from above or below!
 - Fix final two notes in the "game over" tune
- Two-color Mr. Do sprite with four frames of animation
- Updated phase colors/patterns to match arcade levels
- Ball cool down removed during alpha monster mode.

Wish list/To do list:
- Swap voice channels for Can Can song so that the song is still recognizable when only one channel plays (such as when the ball is launched or the falling apple sound cancels out channel 01)
