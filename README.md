# Mr. Do Arcade ColecoVision Rom Hack

This work is based on the original Mr. Do game for the ColecoVision and was made possible by the disassembly work done by Captain Cosmos on the Atari Age forums.

Changes:
- Main background music (the Can Can song)
- Extra Mr. Do tune (Astro Boy theme song)
- Lose a life jingle
- End of round jingle
- "Extra" letter mode/chomper jingle
- Updated sprite for the chompers (WIP, may revisit)
- Screen stays red for "Extra" letter/chomper mode
- Extra Mr. Do image - currently a very rough temporary placeholder image until I figure out how to properly display an image without it being garbled
 

Wish list/To do list:

- Fix full screen image display for Extra Mr. Do, replace placeholder image with something that resembles the arcade version
- Update collision detection so Mr. Do doesn't get stuck after intersecting an apple.
- Update phase colors/patterns to match arcade levels
- Swap voice channels for Can Can song so that the song is still recognizable when only one channel plays (such as when the ball is launched or the falling apple sound cancels out channel 01)
- Clean up screen transitions for Extra Mr. Do screen
- Two-color Mr. Do sprite 
- Update EXTRA enemy sprites
- Arcade Title screen
